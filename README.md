# TravelComfy_Public

TravelComfy is a travel planning app. It takes all the places of interests entered by the user and comes out with the most optimized route, with detailed route information from one waypoint to another. Afterwards, TravelComfy will extract hotels and activities information from its partnersâ€™ websites and list them with their links in an excel file. The user can then book hotels and reserve popular activities in this excel file. TravelComfy will also give out recommendations on which waypoint to stay overnight according to their hotel prices and the distance from one waypoint to another. At the end, the finalized route and reserved hotels will be displayed on the map.
